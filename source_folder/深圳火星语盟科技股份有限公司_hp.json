Another fantastic advantage is improved SEO. Because search engines cannot extract keywords from videos, the subtitling will convert your moving images into written words that will count toward your ranking.\nSocial Media Video Translation Services\nStudies show that almost every company that creates and distributes video content through their social media accounts brings at least one new customer. Yet video remains the least-used format across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It’s your chance to translate and localize your video content and stay ahead of the competition.\nWhy is translation necessary? It will maximize your worldwide reach. With more than 50% of online content in English, chances are you have English content as well. But why limit your business to English speakers, who only make up around 23 percent of internet users? Unlock your true potential with Mars Translation. We will help you translate your social media videos into Spanish, German, Chinese, and many other languages by providing multilingual video captioning services at market competitive rates.\nWe are taking ‘one-stop-solution’ to the next level\nWe are the solution of your every problem\n  Subtitling\nAdd translated subtitles to your video in 230+ languages\n  Transcreation\nTranslate your video by an expert in @ 2500 words / day\n  Transcription\nConvert verbal form of words of video into written form\n  Voice-over\nGet bespoken voice-over in native accent by an expert\nMars Translation and Amara have been collaborating on video transcription and subtitling for a long time. We weekly dispatch 7 – 10 video hours per week for Amara – delivering par excellence for Amara’s success.\n‘Why Us’ – It is all about ‘only us’!\nChoose 'Us' and we will never let you down\n  Rates\nWe offer competitive rates, starting from $0.05 /word\n  Time\nWe are acclaimed to have fastest turnaround time of 2500 words/day.\n  Languages\nWe have something for everyone - serve in 230+ languages\n  Industries\nOur industry specialist translators are here all the major industries\nCustomer Feedback\nOur happy customers are a proof of our continuous growth over the course of almost two decades\nRick Wong\nGreat experience all around.

We can help you translate it into as many languages (and dialects) as your target audience speaks. Our mission is to provide you with the best video translation solutions over the web. To accomplish this goal, we strive to offer our video translations at the best possible market prices.\nWhen you hire a video translator with us, you will love the speed, accuracy, and quality of translations produced. Following a robust and well-established video translation process, our experts work diligently to reflect the meaning of your spoken content accurately and idiomatically. Each linguist on our team is an expert in their domain and can easily translate video to English, Chinese, French, Russian, and whatnot.\nYouTube Video Translation Services\nThere’s no doubt people love consuming video content. To capitalize on this opportunity, a vast majority of brands and marketers are creating videos on YouTube, the most popular video-sharing platform with millions of daily searches. If you fall into this category, you must ensure that your video speaks the language of your target audience, otherwise, they might just click away.\nTo help clients like yourself, Mars Translation has the right solution. We translate YouTube videos into over 230 languages. With the help of our video translation services, you can professionally translate your product tutorials, educational videos, vlogs, and other visual content for your end users. Hence, delivering an engaging viewing experience to the audience, in their own language.\nOur Multilingual Video Subtitling Services\nBeing a well-known provider of professional video translation services, Mars Translation offers first-rate video subtitling services to its clients. Our focus is to help your videos crash through the language barriers and be discovered globally. This is possible when you consult a video subtitling service for your brand.\nNo matter what foreign language you choose to target, our linguists have you covered. They will work together to decipher what’s being said in the original video and add captions at the bottom screen so that viewers who speak different languages can easily comprehend it. Another fantastic advantage is improved SEO. Because search engines cannot extract keywords from videos, the subtitling will convert your moving images into written words that will count toward your ranking.\nSocial Media Video Translation Services\nStudies show that almost every company that creates and distributes video content through their social media accounts brings at least one new customer. Yet video remains the least-used format across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It’s your chance to translate and localize your video content and stay ahead of the competition.\nWhy is translation necessary? It will maximize your worldwide reach. With more than 50% of online content in English, chances are you have English content as well. But why limit your business to English speakers, who only make up around 23 percent of internet users? Unlock your true potential with Mars Translation. We will help you translate your social media videos into Spanish, German, Chinese, and many other languages by providing multilingual video captioning services at market competitive rates.\nWe are taking ‘one-stop-solution’ to the next level\nWe are the solution of your every problem\n  Subtitling\nAdd translated subtitles to your video in 230+ languages\n  Transcreation\nTranslate your video by an expert in @ 2500 words / day\n  Transcription\nConvert verbal form of words of video into written form\n  Voice-over\nGet bespoken voice-over in native accent by an expert\nMars Translation and Amara have been collaborating on video transcription and subtitling for a long time.

      "body": "SIGN IN\nContact Sales\nOrder Now\nHome   Blog   Which languages are the most widely spoken in Africa?\nWhich Languages Are The Most Widely Spoken In Africa?\nBy: Admin Posted on 3 days ago\nAfrica is the second largest and second most populous continent. As recent statistics suggest, 1,486,275,887 is the current population of Africa. The history of Africa is quite long and complex. The historians also believe that eastern Africa was the place that worked as the origin of humans. The human civilizations earlier including Ancient Egypt as well as Carthage have been told to emerge in North Africa. Due to a complex and extensive history of civilizations that nurtured in Africa including migration and trade, Africa has been home to thousands of ethnicities, cultures, and languages.\nIf you often ponder about how many languages are spoken in Africa, the African languages list is never-ending. Due to its rich diversity, this continent has had many languages. A great conflict that is often witnessed when we talk about African languages, they also treat many dialects as languages. However, these start from 1250 and are around 2100 making it home to around one-third of the world’s languages. Many count these to be around 3000. Interestingly, all these languages belong to different language families.\nTable of Content\nImportant language groups of Africa\nNiger-Congo\nAfroasiatic language family\nNilo Saharan\nAustronesian\nKhoe Kwadi languages\nIndo European languages\nAfrican countries with a maximum number of languages\nMost widely spoken languages of Africa\nSwahili\nFrench\nArabic\nHausa\nYoruba\nOromo\nNeed for Translation Services in Africa\nConclusion\nImportant Language Groups Of Africa\nA few languages that are native to the African continent and are the most spoken African languages dominating the continent are Afroasiatic and Niger-Congo. Other hundred belong to the smaller families, including small situations and scenarios.\nA few of the big language families common in Africa are:\nNiger-Congo\nThis family includes the Atlantic Congo and Bantu branches in west central, southern, and southeast Africa. It includes the largest number of languages which are from 1350 – 1650. These are the largest among the four. These are not only the most spoken languages in Africa but in the world. This group includes the most commonly spoken African languages including Swahili. Yoruba, Igbo, and Fula.\nAfroasiatic language family\nThe next family is Afroasiatic, and it has spread throughout Western Asia, North Africa, and among parts of the Sahel. This is the second-largest family with around 200-300 member languages that are part of African languages. They are mainly found in northern regions of the continent. This includes northern Nigeria, southern Niger, Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Additionally, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are part of the northern region.\nNilo Saharan\nThe Nilo Saharan macro family includes Saharan Nilotic and central Sudanic languages.\nAustronesian\nThere are Austronesian languages that they speak in Madagascar and a few parts of Comoros.\nKhoe Kwadi languages\nKhoe Kwadi languages are languages of Namibia and Botswana.\nIndo European languages\nIndo-European languages which are not native to Africa though have many speakers in Namibia.\nOther than these big language families’ African languages also include small groups such as languages that have been isolated. Additionally, there are a few creoles and languages that require classification. It is important to mention that Africa also has a variety of sign languages.\nAfrican Countries With A Maximum Number Of Languages\nWhen it comes to the country that has most languages of Africa in practice, it is none other than Nigeria. As the Ethnologue suggests, there are up to 500 languages that are spoken in the country. It also happens to host the greatest linguistic diversity in the world. Cameroon is the second country on the list with 227 languages followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo with 214 languages.\nMost Widely Spoken Languages Of Africa\nA few of the most spoken and popular languages of Africa are as follows.\nSwahili\nSwahili is the most spoken among African languages list. There are up to 200 million speakers of this language, among which 18 million are native speakers. Kiswahili is the local name of the language. It is a Bantu language from the Sabaki branch native to the people settled in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique. Speaking of this, Tanzania is said to have the most native speakers of Swahili language.\nSwahili is, hence, the language of Africa in terms of maximum speakers. Swahili has a significant number of loanwords from languages such as Arabic, Portuguese, German, and English. Interestingly, 15 percent of the Swahili vocabulary is from Arabic.\nOne of the modern standard Swahili which is written in Latin is spoken in Zanzibar city. The traditional font that scholars use to write Swahili literature and poetry is Swahili Ajami. The root of this is Kiamu which is a dialect of Lamu from the Kenyan coast.\nA few old dialects of the Swahili language include:\nKimwani\nChimwiini\nKibajuni\nBajuni\nSocotra Swahili\nSidi\nFrench\nThe much-loved and popular romance language of Indo-European families is French. It is the descendant of the vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. French has up to 450 million speakers as shared in a 2022 report by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is the official language of 28 states and is fondly spoken in all the continents.\nThe African continent is no different. French in Africa or African French as they name it based on general varieties of the French language has an estimated number of speakers around 167 million. French is quite popular in the African languages list and is in use with other indigenous languages of the continent. Interestingly it has become the first language in many states, particularly in Central Africa, Abidjan Ivory coast, etc.\nAlgeria has the most French-speaking population in Africa which is up to 32.86 % as per statistics shared in 2022. Moreover, five varieties of African French are commonly spoken on the continent. African French has many dialects commonly spoken. However, these dialects have a natural influence on the native languages which are common in the respective country.\nThree of the more common French dialects are\nAfrican French\nAbidjan French\nIvorian French\nKinshasa French\nArabic\nArabic is next on the list of most common languages in Africa. There are 100 million people who have been speaking Arabic in Africa for centuries. This proves the external influences that have also played a vital role in shaping the dynamics of life over the centuries.\nArabic serves more as an official language in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Senegal, and Niger. This is the official language of up to 26 states. This happens to be the third most popular language worldwide after English and French, also part of the 6 official languages of the United Nations. Arabic is one of the most ancient languages with 32 varieties as assigned by ISO.\nThe four major Arabic dialects include\nPeninsular\nMesopotamian\nLevantine\nMaghrebi\nHausa\nHausa comes from the West African language. They speak it in Nigeria mainly as well as in Niger, Ghana, and Cameroon. There are up to 80 million speakers of Hausa in Africa and there are people in France who also speak Hausa. A radio station in Hausa broadcasts in Issoudun (France). Hausa works as a language of trade and business. Many international units teach this language.\nMoreover, it also serves as the lingua franca of the Muslim population in the region. This language has a writing system close to Arabic script and Latin. The Latin alphabet, however, Boko is the common script that they use these days.\nHausa is an African language that is tonal. It has 5 vowels, and all five of these can either be high or low, which makes them 10 collectively. Though these vowels have their significance in written communication, it is not used in the routine. Moreover, there are no diacritics in everyday use. So pitch has a key role in making the words clear and understandable.\nYoruba\nYoruba is the next most spoken African language. It is particularly spoken in West Africa. It’s a pluricentric language, which indicates that multiple varieties of languages are in use and mutually intelligible.\nYoruba is particularly common in Afro-Brazilian religion. It has around 55 million speakers. The speakers of Yoruba are there across Nigeria, Togo, and Benin. Moreover, there are different variations which are called dialects such as Egba, Ibadan, Oyo, and Ekiti.\nYoruba also holds the significance of being an African language of its literary tradition. There are many poems, stories, and proverbs written in this language. It has its origin in Nigeria and there was no writing system until the 19th century before colonization. Later it was influenced by the European languages and had an altogether different version.\nOromo\nOromo is another native language of Ethiopia. It is also common in Kenya. Oromo was traditionally spoken by the Oromo people and the relevant ethnic groups that were settled in the Horn of Africa. There are around 35 million speakers of this language.\nOromo also serves as the official language of Ethiopia. They used Latin script for writing it. Moreover, the Oromo speakers have been quite good with the extremely evolved oral storytelling tradition. Oromo is one complex language comparatively.\nMoreover, it has seven grammatical cases with five long and short vowels. An interesting fact to quote is here that the sounds such as /p/, /z/, and /v/ were not part of the language historically. Hence, they only use it for the adopted words developed recently.\nNeed For Translation Services In Africa\nTranslation services have been playing a vital role in bridging the language gap for centuries now. Though the trend of globalization and internationalization is more common now, it existed in every era in different shapes and forms. Moreover, the African continent is a linguistically rich region that is home to the largest number of languages globally. The businesses seek translation services to widen their reach and mark their place in the African continent.\nTherefore, if you are a business that intends to tap the African market, you need to be vigilant with your choice and selection of a language translation company in Africa. You can reach Mars Translation for accurate, premium, high-quality translation delivered by native speakers.\nConclusion\nAfrica is one of the world’s most populated continents. It has been home to multiple ethnic groups and cultures. There are up to 2000 active languages in the continent. The important language groups include the Niger-Congo, Afroasiatic, Austronesian, and Indo-European language families. Moreover, the most widely spoken languages include Swahili, French, Arabic, Hausa, Yoruba, and Oromo, among others.\nRelated Blogs\nTop 10 Translation Services Companies in Florida\nNo state on the

Belgium has three official languages, but there isn’t one central language that can be called the Belgian or Belgium language. For ages, Belgium has been deeply inspired by its powerful neighbors France, Netherlands, and Germany.\nThis could be a reason why its three official languages belong to these regions and linguistic backgrounds. While exploring the languages of a region, seeing a combination of the many languages and sub-dialects could become more confusing. We’ve got you covered to navigate through Belgium languages, and why understanding them can be of great help.\nRead this article to dive deeper into its rich linguistic landscape.\nTable of Content\nBelgium: A Land of Three Official Languages\nDutch (Flemish)\nHistory of Dutch (Flemish)\nFrench\nHistory of French\nGerman\nLuxembourgish and Others\nCan I Get Around With English in Belgium\nLanguage Tips for Your Belgian Trip\nDon’t Let the Linguistic Complexities Hold You Back\nBelgium: A Land Of Three Official Languages\nBelgium is a haven for chocolate fanatics. It is famous for chocolates, denser Brussels waffles, century-old beers, historical sites and most importantly world-famous music festival Tomorrowland. Belgium doesn’t have a single, unified language but it has three official languages that are widely used in different regions.\nDutch (Flemish).\nFrench\nGerman\nFrench and Dutch are mainly taught in Belgian schools, making the majority of Belgians bilingual. While Dutch (Flemish) is used in the Flemish communities, French is widely spoken in Wallonia. Moreover, Brussels, the most densely populated area in Belgium, has French as the predominant language. Flemish is also gaining traction and it’s no surprise that you will find a huge volume of Flemish speakers as it shares official status.\nDutch (Flemish)\nDutch belongs to the West Germanic language family, sharing common values with English, German, and Frisian. Dutch carves its path over time and becomes the most widely used language not only in Belgium but in the Netherlands also. Around 60% of the population are native Dutch speakers, accounting for 6.5 million people in Belgium. The Dutch-speaking community resides in the northern region of Flanders. It is also the official language of French living in Brussels. Dutch (Flemish) is the most common language spoken in Belgium.\nHistory Of Dutch (Flemish)\nWhen Belgium became part of the Netherlands, a voice for linguistic dominance arose. The Dutch officials tried to impose Dutch as the only language of the region. However, Belgian independence in 1830 shattered these efforts. Meanwhile, the French language was taught in schools for decades. This changed in the late 90s after increasing linguistic conflicts and issues.\nFrench\nFrench ranks second in the list of most-spoken languages in Belgium. You can find the majority of French-speaking people in the Wallonia region and Brussels, the capital of Belgium. French account for almost 40% of the Belgian population (4.5 million). French spoken in Belgium is quite similar to standard French in France. So, if you aren’t sure about learning another language, you can use French to communicate with locals. However, it still depends on which area you’re visiting or your target region. French won’t help you in Dutch-speaking or German-speaking areas.\nHistory of French\nThe French gained a significant reputation in Belgium through its historical connections with France. The language gained status and was linked with social mobility, resulting in its widespread adoption in education and administration. The French even took over areas where Dutch was widely popular. However, the current focus is on promoting Dutch in major regions to ensure language equality throughout Belgium.\nGerman\nThe German-speaking population roughly covers 1% (75,000) of the entire Belgium population. You will find German speakers in the eastern regions of the population of Belgium. This population became part of Belgium after World War I and that’s why the language spoken here closely resembles standard German. While German doesn’t represent the majority in Belgium, it is among the Belgium official languages because of its historical context and regional distribution.\nYou might be wondering if 60% of the Belgians speak Dutch and the rest of the 40% of the population speak French. Does it mean these two languages cover the entire population? You need to stop here and think again. Well, we know its population is bilingual so people who have proficiency in Dutch also use French as their second language. The same goes for German as well. When people live in a diverse community, they get to know about different languages and cultures. Belgium is a prime example of a region with diverse cultures and linguistic backgrounds.\nLuxembourgish And Others\nIf you believe Dutch, French, and German are the only languages used in Belgium, you’re misinformed. Beyond the official three, Luxembourgish, the native language of Arelerland, is widely spoken in the Belgian province of Luxembourg. It is often regarded as the fourth language. Though Luxembourgish isn’t a national language, it is still recognized as a minority language by the French community. However, Belgian French has replaced it since the late 20th century despite its thriving usage in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nThe linguistic landscape of Belgium also includes some immigrant languages. People move to Belgium for better work opportunities and lifestyle. These immigrant languages were derived as a result of migration over the last few decades. Among these languages are Berber, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Italian, Greek, Polish and English to name a few.\nExploring The Dialects Of Belgium’S Language\nBelgium’s linguistic adventure doesn’t stop here. It’s a bit complicated but we’re here to assist you to understand each language and its dialects. At this point, you have a clear understanding of what language they speak in Belgium. Now, let's talk about some famous dialects and their usage for each specific region.\nBelgium features a compelling range of Germanic and Romance dialects. While exploring Belgium, you will find their speakers across many famous regions. Flemish dialects of Limburgish, Brabantian, and East and West Flemish are among the widely used dialects. The German-speaking region also has a common dialect Low Dietsch influenced by the German language. Moving ahead, the French-speaking area of Belgium is home to a vibrant tapestry of notable French dialects like Walloon, Picard, Lorrain, and Champenios. Each dialect adds a unique flavor to the French spoken in Belgium.\nCan I Get Around With English In Belgium?\nThough there is no straightforward yes or no answer for this statement. It all depends on which region you are visiting or targeting. As around 55% of the Belgium population can understand English, some areas are comfortable with English while some prefer official languages only. People working in hospitality and other touristy sectors will speak English. However, locals in Belgium appreciate people who go the extra mile to learn their language and try to communicate in it. Hence, relying on the English language only will make things complicated for you. We have observed that European travelers manage to communicate with locals in Belgium. Because the languages spoken in Belgium are also widely used in major areas of Europe.\nLanguage Tips for Your Belgian Trip\nBelgium is attracting international tourists for several reasons. Firstly, the country capitalizes on cultural gems. From the medieval charm of Bruges to the artistic heritage of Antwerp, Belgium has a lot to offer to history and art enthusiasts. Another important thing that fascinates international tourists is unique experiences like beer tastings, exploring the beauty of the Ardennes region, and attending local festivals. You’re visiting Belgium because you probably want a break and witness the natural beauty of the world-famous European attraction. However, the lore of your tour fades away if you don’t have a bridge to communicate and interact with locals.\nIt’s important to explore the common Belgium languages; however, it is even more important to speak the right language in the right place. As Belgium is a multilingual paradise, you need to understand the geographical background of each language. You simply cannot communicate in Flemish if you’re in Wallonia. Chances are high that people won’t be able to understand you. Similarly, your linguistic expertise in French won’t work in Flanders and its neighboring areas. To avoid these upsets, you should speak the right language in the right place.\nDon’T Let The Linguistic Complexities Hold You Back\nPlanning to visit Belgium to explore its natural beauty or seek opportunities for your business, but afraid of language barriers? Well, this is something that needs your quick attention to get the most out of your next visit. Visiting Belgium without exploring its official languages is like going on an adventure blindfolded. From the enchanting beauty of Bruges to the grassy forests of the Ardennas, Belgium holds a bunch of attractions that captivate travelers from around the world. Our language translation services in Belgium will introduce you to different cultures and translate the right language for the right place so you can experience its beautiful places in the best way possible and get the most out of your business visits.\nRelated Blogs\nWhich languages are the most widely spoken in Africa?\nAfrica is the second largest and second most populous continent.

The culture and languages spoken in Switzerland are highly influenced by its neighbors, particularly Germany. Moreover, the World Wars also have a profound effect on migration patterns and socio-economic conditions which also contributes greatly to language variations.\nHowever, Switzerland did not face many problems because it remained neutral during the wars. Moreover, the mountainous peaks offer a lot of protection and make the country difficult to invade. Hence, many sought a safe haven in Swiss borders during the war, and to this day Switzerland is known for its pacifist approach.\nTable of Content\nSwitzerland has Four National Languages\nExploring the Region: 4 Languages of Sweden\nThe Most Spoken Swiss Language: German\nThe La Romandie Region of French\nThe Sunny South of Italian\nThe Minority Language Romansh\nOther Unofficial Languages of Switzerland\nYenish\nFranco Provencal (Arpitan)\nWestern Lombard (Insubric)\nGrow Your Business in Switzerland With Mars Translation\nWant to know what language does Switzerland speak? Read on to find out!\nSwitzerland Has Four National Languages\nSwitzerland is famous for creamy chocolates, gorgeous mountains, banks, luxury watches, and its history of pacifism. The immigration patterns as discussed above are the reason for diverse cultures within Switzerland and exactly why the country has not one, two, but four national languages:\nGerman\nFrench\nItalian\nRomansh\nThis linguistic diversity can be attributed to two things. The first is the open border policies of Europe, and the second is due to people wanting to escape the terrors of war in the 1940s.\nExploring The Region: 4 Languages Of Sweden\nThe Swiss enjoy a rich tapestry of languages that reflects the unique culture and history of the region. Language translation services in Switzerland are commonly used by tourists, businessmen, educators, and more. Because of the uniqueness of dialects, pronunciations, and cultural nuances. Join us, as we dive deeper into the pools of multilingualism of Switzerland.\nThe Most Spoken Swiss Language: German\nGerman is spoken by 60%-65% of the Swiss population. But it is not the standard German you may be thinking of. The dominant form of German spoken in Switzerland is (Schwyzerdütsch), which is an Alemannic dialect. The Almemannic dialect is different from the one spoken in Austria and Germany. Swiss German contains unique grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary, which can be difficult to comprehend even for fluent German speakers.\nDeutschschweiz is known as the German-speaking region of Switzerland, which comprises of Eastern and Northern parts of the country, with major cities such as Basel, Bern, and Zurich. The German language is by far the most dominant Switzerland language, as it is used in education, written communication, and formal settings.\nThe La Romandie Region Of French\nFrench is the second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland. It is spoken by 20%-25% of the Swiss population. The language is more common in the western region, known as the La Romandie. This region includes Lausanne, Geneva, and Neuchátel. The vibrant cities along with its close proximity to France give the Swiss-French a unique sort of dialect. If you are a sports enthusiast, you will enjoy the fact that the Tour De France also passes through this region.\nThe Swiss-French sounds different from the standard French with subtle differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. French is the language of culture, media, and administration in Switzerland. Depending upon your business niche and target region, expanding in Switzerland may require business translations in French language. If you need a reliable partner for French translation, Mars Translation is your go-to option!\nThe Sunny South Of Italian\nAbout 8%-10% of the Swiss population are Italian speakers, and most of them lie in the south near the borderless border with Italy. Most of Switzerland's Italian speaking population is from the Canton of Ticino, Svizzera Italiana, and parts of Grisons. The dialect spoken is commonly referred to as the Lombard dialect, which is common in northern Italy. Unlike other language dialects, Italian can be easily understood by the locals. There is a hint of influence from French and German.\nThe Minority Language Romansh\nMany say that Romansh is a dying language. It is the least-spoken Swiss official language, with only 0.5% of speakers in the populace. The speakers mostly inhabit parts of Eastern Switzerland with a major concentration in Graubúnden. Romansh is often referred to as Switzerland’s hidden language because it is difficult to find people speaking it commonly.\nMoreover, it is not an easy language to learn and understand either. The Rahaeto-Romance language has Latin roots and is divided into 5 different dialects. Romansh speakers are rare in the world with only 40,000-80,000 total speakers in the world. It is a remarkable testament to the Swiss commitment to linguistic diversity.\nOther Unofficial Languages Of Switzerland\nIt is interesting to note that the official languages do not represent the traditional languages spoken in the country. Though there is a resemblance to the predominant languages, they still have their own characteristics.\n4. Yenish\nThis language is a variant of German, which includes special and unique words, but barely has its own grammar. Moreover, Yenish is spoken by the Yenish people, who are semi-nomadic and often referred to as Gypsies. Many were prosecuted after the war and many migrated to Switzerland. These people were mainly from Germany, but migrated during the 1940s and 1950s to various parts of Europe. Most of them migrated to neighboring countries.\nHowever, from all the countries they migrated to. Only Switzerland gave them representation by recognizing Yenish as an official language. The number of Yenish speakers has only declined over the years and today barely 0.5% of the Swiss population speaks the language.\n2. Franco Provencal (Arpitan)\nThe language is rarely spoken and UNESCO has declared it an endangered language. It is currently only found spoken in Italy, France, and of course Switzerland. Only about 200,000 people can speak the language, with most of them residing in Italy.\n3. Western Lombard (Insubric)\nTraditionally, the language is spoken in parts of northern Italy. However, the use of the language is diminishing with time, and people prefer speaking regular Italian instead. The language is classified as endangered, and it does not seem like it will be revived given the current circumstances. The Swiss though have made efforts to preserve the language by promoting it in mainstream media. But despite the efforts, people are more inclined to speak normal Italian.\nGrow Your Business In Switzerland With Mars Translation\nIf you aim to grow your business in Switzerland, you must opt for translation in Switzerland official languages.

Currently, the UK encompasses four geographical locations, namely: Scotland, Wales, England, and Northern Ireland. Previously, the Republic of Ireland was also a part of the British Empire but gained independence in 1922. Today, the Irish War of Independence may still strike up anger against the Britishers. But the neighbors live peacefully and conduct trade on a daily basis. Even though the Republic of Ireland is not a part of the UK anymore. Both share a lot in common and most of what we discuss is also applicable in that region.\nMarketing to any audience requires you to thoroughly understand their preferences, and the UK is no different. People need to relate, resonate, and have their needs felt catered to. Only then can you capture their undivided attention.\nTable of Content\nHow to Reach the UK Audience?\nBe Mindful of Language Variations\nUnique Wit & Humor\nThings to Avoid in Language\nEven More Nuances in Language\nBeyond Words Translations\nBonus Tip To Reach UK Audience: Celebrity Endorsement\nBut Why?\nConclusion\nHow To Reach The UK Audience?\nToday, our topic is focused on the United Kingdom specifically. I will give you some examples near the end, to help make certain aspects clearer.\nBe Mindful of Language Variations\nAs I said at the beginning, the United Kingdom is a diverse place. Even though more than 91.1% of the UK population speaks English as their primary language. You will see a lot of regional variations in accent, vocabulary, and grammar. For instance, terms commonly used in England will vary from those used in Wales and Scotland. This is one reason why hiring a good translation company is often key to engagement. These professional linguists are experienced enough to understand what region requires what tone, vocabulary, and intent.\nUnique Wit & Humor\nBritish humor unlike American humor is not fully out of their kind of humor. The Britishers prefer dry humor that mostly revolves around wit, irony, and sarcasm. Moreover, humor that is done with a subtle approach instead of the right in-your-face humor. Here is where you see the value of the resource you may hire professionals from top-rated companies for UK translations.\nA good translator will adapt your content to ensure that the sarcasm, dry wit, and irony is characterized by British humor. If you ever watch the British version of ‘The Office’ you will know what I mean. Another reason why hiring a professional linguistic translation company is better is because there is a very thin line between funny and offensive in British culture.\nThings to Avoid in Language\nThe British actually prefer it when people express gratitude and politeness. Boasting how great you are and being super direct is taken negatively by them. They will spite you or avoid you if they think you are haughty. Even worse, they may even start to campaign against you and turn you into a meme. Another thing to remember is the class system, though not as prominent as it once was in the Victorian era. But it still exists nonetheless. By remembrance of the class system, I mean remember not to use language or images that can be considered snobbish or cater to only specific classes.\nEven More Nuances in Language\nVacabulary\nAmerican English British English\nApartment Flat\nCollege University\nVacation Holiday\nSchedule Timetable\nAirplane Aeroplane\nMailbox Postbox\nCookie Biscuit\nSweater Jumper\nThere are many forms of English in the world. But two forms are most commonly associated with global communications. One is American-English and the other is British-English. You might already be familiar with this, given the fact that it is common knowledge. But for those who aren’t clear about the nuance between them, I will explain it. British and American English sounds similar, but it has the exception of a few spoken words and written ones. Both differ from one another based on:\nExample: ‘Colour’ in Britain vs. ‘Color’ in America or ‘Organise’ in Britain vs. ‘Organize’ in America.\nVocabulary\nExample: ‘Colour’ in Britain vs. ‘Color’ in America or ‘Organise’ in Britain vs. ‘Organize’ in America.\nSpellings\n‘Put in your Tuppence’ in Britain vs. ‘Put in your Two Cents’ in America or ‘To be in a Pickel’ in Britain vs ‘To be in a Jam’ in America.\nIdiomatic Expression\nBusiness communication is more formal in Britain as compared to America which has a mixed approach.\nInformal & Formal Tones\nBeyond Words Translations\nWhen you translate or localize content for another market. It is not just the language that changes. There are many other forms of communication that are equally important. For instance, people in Britain drive on the left side of the road, and Americans on the right. When translating for the UK, you need to be mindful of the date format, currency symbols, metric systems, and more.\nIf you translate some accurately and ignore other forms, you will lose consumer confidence. Another reason why hiring professional linguists is a good idea. They are familiar with such issues and experienced enough to provide accurate and fast translations.\nBonus Tip To Reach UK Audience: Celebrity Endorsement\nYes, that’s right. Celebrity endorsement has proved to be very powerful in gaining the attention of the UK audience. Here’s an example of your better understanding. Example\nRonaldo played football for Manchester United for 6 years and during that time he established himself as a fan favorite all over the UK. Moreover, given the popularity of the game, Ronaldo became world-famous. Hence, when ‘Clear’ launched its Shampoo in the UK, it was not gaining traction. But as soon as the same product was endorsed by Cristiano Ronaldo in an advertisement, people in the UK began to change their minds about the product.\nBut Why?\nWell, people changed their minds because at the time Ronaldo was trending in UK news, sports, and fashion. He was an icon, and everything related to him was eaten up by the public. Hence, Cristiano Ronaldo was culturally relevant to the UK audience, as he is in many places during his illustrious career. So his brand image is like the ultimate seal of approval.\nIf for example, someone other than Ronaldo was used, the product would not have gained so much traction during that time. It’s like David Beckham and Victoria during the 90s. Both had extreme commercial value because of their popularity in British culture.\nConclusion\nBefore we sign off, another important bit of advice is to stay current with trends relevant to the UK. When you relate your content and marketing to trending topics, you are more likely to come into the limelight. Moreover, you are also more likely to establish two-way communication with your target audience. Another important thing to remember is that culture is continuously developing and changing.\nA reason why it is important to hire professionals for translation and localization. If you are planning to grow your online business in the UK, Mars Translation can help by translating your business documents and localizing your digital presence. It will help you to create a lasting impact and make your mark in the competitive market there. Good luck guys!

We can help you translate it into as many languages (and dialects) as your target audience speaks. Our mission is to provide you with the best video translation solutions over the web. To accomplish this goal, we strive to offer our video translations at the best possible market prices.\nWhen you hire a video translator with us, you will love the speed, accuracy, and quality of translations produced. Following a robust and well-established video translation process, our experts work diligently to reflect the meaning of your spoken content accurately and idiomatically. Each linguist on our team is an expert in their domain and can easily translate video to English, Chinese, French, Russian, and whatnot.\nYouTube Video Translation Services\nThere’s no doubt people love consuming video content. To capitalize on this opportunity, a vast majority of brands and marketers are creating videos on YouTube, the most popular video-sharing platform with millions of daily searches. If you fall into this category, you must ensure that your video speaks the language of your target audience, otherwise, they might just click away.\nTo help clients like yourself, Mars Translation has the right solution. We translate YouTube videos into over 230 languages. With the help of our video translation services, you can professionally translate your product tutorials, educational videos, vlogs, and other visual content for your end users. Hence, delivering an engaging viewing experience to the audience, in their own language.\nOur Multilingual Video Subtitling Services\nBeing a well-known provider of professional video translation services, Mars Translation offers first-rate video subtitling services to its clients. Our focus is to help your videos crash through the language barriers and be discovered globally. This is possible when you consult a video subtitling service for your brand.\nNo matter what foreign language you choose to target, our linguists have you covered. They will work together to decipher what’s being said in the original video and add captions at the bottom screen so that viewers who speak different languages can easily comprehend it. Another fantastic advantage is improved SEO. Because search engines cannot extract keywords from videos, the subtitling will convert your moving images into written words that will count toward your ranking.\nSocial Media Video Translation Services\nStudies show that almost every company that creates and distributes video content through their social media accounts brings at least one new customer. Yet video remains the least-used format across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It’s your chance to translate and localize your video content and stay ahead of the competition.\nWhy is translation necessary? It will maximize your worldwide reach. With more than 50% of online content in English, chances are you have English content as well. But why limit your business to English speakers, who only make up around 23 percent of internet users? Unlock your true potential with Mars Translation. We will help you translate your social media videos into Spanish, German, Chinese, and many other languages by providing multilingual video captioning services at market competitive rates.\nWe are taking ‘one-stop-solution’ to the next level\nWe are the solution of your every problem\n  Subtitling\nAdd translated subtitles to your video in 230+ languages\n  Transcreation\nTranslate your video by an expert in @ 2500 words / day\n  Transcription\nConvert verbal form of words of video into written form\n  Voice-over\nGet bespoken voice-over in native accent by an expert\nMars Translation and Amara have been collaborating on video transcription and subtitling for a long time.
